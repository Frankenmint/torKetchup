# waht is this?

Welp after using rss feeds then having them go away for a while for whatever reasons, I've come back to enable them thinking everything was just going to download...oooops... okay so let's build a small scraper to query toorgle for a given show in format `{Name S{x}E{y}}`  like Family Guy S22E01 and, for each successive episode desired, repeat the same action such that it searches toorgle clicks the first result then clicks onto that magnet link.  I like french fries with Ketchup... so it all made sense for this to happen ;)



## requirements

You'll need python 2.7 and to have a torrent client that can open magnet links.  

## todo 

Optimizations  
An arguments option to allow shortcutting the question prompts  
test toorgle now that the script has been deployed and see if greater consistency is achieved there
